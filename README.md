# Quadratic Equations Solver 

'Quadratic Equations Solver' is a python code for finding 
1. the roots, 
2. converting between *vertix* and *standard* forms, 
3. graphing 
quadratic equations

## Installation 

Use the package manager to install 'requirements.txt' file 

## Usage 

### 'main.py' 

uses a **case-switch** mechanism 
	for letting the user perform the desired operation 
	*a, b, c, d* actions as needed 
		a. from standard form to vertix - prints the exact roots and a graph 
		b. from vertix form to standard - prints a graph 
		c. prints the exact roots of the quadratic equation starting from standard form, using quadratic formula 
		d. prints the integer roots of the quadratic equation if any starting from standard form, using factoring 
	choose action by assinging 
		n = *a, b, c or d* 

also assign values to variables 
	--y= a*x**2 + b*x + c--, 
	--y = a*(x - h)**2 + k-- 

### 'graphing_quadratic.py' 

is responsible for the graphing functionality of the code 
	you do **not need to do anything with it** 

### 'change_forms.py' 
	is responsible for converting between the *standard* and *vertix* format functionality of the code 
	you do **not need to do anything with it** 

### 'solving_roots.py' 
	is responsible for finding the roots using *quadratic formula* or *factoring* 
	you do **not need to do anything with it**
